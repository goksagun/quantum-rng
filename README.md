## Quantum Random Number Generator

A simple example of a quantum algorithm written in Q# is a quantum random number generator. This algorithm leverages the nature of quantum mechanics to produce a random number.

### Prerequisites
- The Microsoft Quantum Development Kit.
- Create a Q# project for either a Q# application, with a Python host program, or a C# host program.


In VS Code, build the Program.qs the first time by typing the below in the terminal:
```
dotnet build
```

For subsequent runs, there is no need to build it again. To run it, type the following command and press enter:
```
dotnet run --no-build
```
